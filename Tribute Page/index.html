          <h2>World Player of the Century</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Edson Arantes do Nascimento</b> 23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022  better known by his nickname Pelé,was a Brazilian Footballer.
            Former United States President Barack Obama eulogised Pele as well, calling him one of the greatest to ever play the beautiful game.
            The London-based Chelsea FC on Thursday called Pele a “master of the beautiful game”, and England defender Harry Maguire said Pele was a “role model on and off the pitch”.
            Pele had served since 1994 as “champion for sport” for the United Nations cultural organisation, 
            UNESCO, helping promote physical education across the world.
            He scored on his debut for Santos and by the end of his first season in Brazil, he was the league's top scorer, at just 16 years of age.
            It was also at this age that Pele was first called up to the Brazilian National squad.
